  "content": "Task completed: Analyze the agent-tools and agent-contracts packages. Spawn two sub-agents: 1) One to read all tool files in agent-tools/src/tools/ and summarize each tool, 2) Another to read agent-contracts/src/events.ts and list all event types. Combine their results.\nResult: ### Summary of Findings\n\n#### 1. **Agent Tools Overview**\nThe `agent-tools` package contains various tools designed for agent operations. Here’s a summary of each tool based on the files found in `agent-tools/src/tools/`:\n\n- **reporting.ts**: Contains tools for agents to communicate with their parent agent. It includes functions to ask for help and report findings.\n  \n- **delegation.ts**: Implements tools for spawning sub-agents to handle subtasks. This allows for task delegation and synchronous waiting for results.\n\n- **todo.ts**: Provides tools for task planning and progress tracking, including creating and updating TODO lists.\n\n- **mass-replace.ts**: A tool for batch text replacement across multiple files, supporting both literal and regex patterns, with features like dry-run mode and file history tracking.\n\n- **search.ts**: Contains search tools for finding files and content, including glob-based searching and exclusion of certain directories.\n\n- **shell.ts**: Implements a tool for executing shell commands and returning their output, useful for running builds and tests.\n\n- **filesystem.ts**: Provides filesystem operations with features like atomic operations, path traversal protection, and size limits.\n\n- **memory.ts**: Implements memory tools for persistent context and session management, including shared and session-specific memory structures.\n\n- **index.ts**: Acts as a registration point for all tools, exporting them for use in the agent framework.\n\n- **interaction.ts**: Contains tools for user interaction, allowing agents to ask questions and receive responses.\n\n#### 2. **Agent Events Overview**\nThe `agent-contracts/src/events.ts` file defines various event types used in the agent system. Here are the key event types:\n\n- **Lifecycle Events**:\n  - `agent:start`\n  - `agent:end`\n  - `agent:error`\n\n- **Iteration Events**:\n  - `iteration:start`\n  - `iteration:end`\n\n- **LLM Events**:\n  - `llm:start`\n  - `llm:chunk` (for streaming responses)\n  - `llm:end`\n\n- **Tool Events**:\n  - `tool:start`\n  - `tool:end`\n  - `tool:error`\n\n- **Sub-agent Lifecycle Events**:\n  - `subtask:start`\n  - `subtask:end`\n\n- **Synthesis Events**:\n  - `synthesis:forced`\n  - `synthesis:start`\n  - `synthesis:complete`\n\n- **Memory Events**:\n  - `memory:read`\n  - `memory:write`\n\n- **Verification Events**:\n  - `verification:start`\n  - `verification:complete`\n\n- **Progress Events**:\n  - `progress:update`\n  - `status:change`\n\n### Conclusion\nThe `agent-tools` package provides a comprehensive set of tools for managing agent operations, including task delegation, reporting, and filesystem interactions. The `agent-contracts` package defines a robust event system that facilitates communication and tracking of various agent activities.\n\n**Confidence Level**: 0.9 (High confidence based on detailed file analysis and definitions found in the codebase.)",
