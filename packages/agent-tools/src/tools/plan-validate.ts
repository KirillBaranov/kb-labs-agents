/**
 * plan_validate tool — LLM-based plan quality gate.
 *
 * Called by the plan-writer agent after drafting a plan to get structured
 * feedback before reporting it as ready. The LLM evaluator receives:
 *   - The original user task (so it can judge relevance)
 *   - The full plan markdown
 *   - The requested evaluation tier (default: small)
 *
 * Returns a human+agent-readable string with:
 *   - passed: yes/no
 *   - score: 0.0–1.0
 *   - Per-dimension breakdown (specificity, actionability, completeness, verification)
 *   - Concrete, actionable feedback for each failing dimension
 *
 * The agent uses this output to decide:
 *   1. passed=yes → call report() with the plan
 *   2. passed=no  → revise the plan based on feedback and call plan_validate again
 *   3. After 3 failed attempts → call ask_user() with the plan + issues

const EVAL_SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are a plan quality evaluator. Evaluate implementation plans written by AI agents.

You will receive the original user task and the plan markdown.

Score the plan on four dimensions (0.0–1.0 each):

**specificity** (weight 0.30)
- Does the plan reference real file paths from the codebase?
- Are function names, class names, or line numbers mentioned where relevant?
- For simple tasks (1-2 files), mentioning those files is sufficient for a high score.
- For complex tasks (many files), more paths are expected.

**actionability** (weight 0.35)
- Can each step be executed without guessing what to do?
- Steps should contain: what file to edit, what to change, or what command to run.
- "Edit X to add Y" is actionable. "Update the configuration" is not.

**completeness** (weight 0.15)
- Does the plan have: task description, steps, verification?
- Are sections substantive (not just headings)?

**verification** (weight 0.20)
- Does the plan include concrete commands to verify correctness?
- At least one build or test command expected.

Respond in EXACTLY this format (no other text before or after):
SCORE: 0.XX
SPECIFICITY: 0.XX
ACTIONABILITY: 0.XX
COMPLETENESS: 0.XX
VERIFICATION: 0.XX
FEEDBACK:
<One paragraph per dimension scoring below 0.7. Quote the weak part, explain the problem, give a fix example. If all dimensions ≥ 0.7, write "Plan meets quality threshold.">

IMPORTANT: Only output the format above. Do NOT output tool calls, code blocks, or any other format.`;
